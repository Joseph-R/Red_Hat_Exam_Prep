A collection of finished and unfinished personal notes I've made for the RHCSA exam.  Will eventually include notes for the RHCE.

Notes are collected primarily from Michael Jang's "RHCSA/RHCE Red Hat Linux Certification Study Guide", 6th edition, which focuses on EX200 and EX300 for Red Hat/CentOS 6.
